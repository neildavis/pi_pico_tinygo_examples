# Lesson 26: Photocell #

This example builds on lesson 24 (Eight LEDs with 74HC595) by adding a
'[photocell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoresistor)', also known as a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR).
The LDR varies its resistance based on the amount of light falling on it.

We combine the LDR with a 1K立 resistor to form a
[voltage divider](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/voltage-dividers/all) between Ground and 3.3V.
Together, these work like a potentiometer that we can read using the Pico's ADC.

We vary the number of LEDs lit according to the ADC signal based on the light falling on the LDR.

## Driver Support ##

In contrast to lesson 24, this time we will use the
[driver](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers/blob/release/shiftregister/shiftregister.go)
available from the [TinyGo drivers](https://github.com/tinygo-org/drivers) project to simplify
our code.

## Connections ##

The connections are the same as for lesson 24, with the addition on the LDR/1K立 voltage divider on ADC0.

Note: For brevity of this table I have not split the Resistors R0-R7 into separate columns
for the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals. The polarity doesn't matter anyway. Just be
aware that the resistor *Rn* is **always** connected in ***series*** **between** the 74HC595 pin
*Qn* and the LED *Ln*. (i.e) do **not connect in *parallel* directly beween *Qn* and *Ln***.
