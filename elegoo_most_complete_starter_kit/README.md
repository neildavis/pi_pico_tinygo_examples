# Elegoo 'The Most Complete Starter Kit' - Pi Pico & TinyGo

The projects in this folder attempt to replicate the 'lessons' supplied with Elegoo's '[The Most Complete Starter Kit UNO R3 Project](https://www.elegoo.com/collections/uno-r3-starter-kits/products/elegoo-uno-most-complete-starter-kit)', only using a [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/) in place of the Arduino Uno R3 & [TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/) as the language. The aim is to use the same components & peripherals supplied with the kit and achieve the same results.
