# Lesson 8: Tilt Ball Switch

An example using a tilt ball switch to detect a small angle of inclination.

Basically just another digital input switch driving the LED from a digital Output.

For this example, connect one pole of the title ball switch to GPIO 10 (phsical pin 14) 
and connect the the other pole of the switch to ground.
