# Lesson 3: LED #

There is no code for this lesson since it consists purely of wiring up an LED directly to the board's power supply with various levels of protective resistor on a breadboard.

Just be sure to jump the following pins to your breadboard power rail:
| Power | Physical pin # |
|-|-|
| 3.3V Out | 36 |
| Ground | 38 |
